# Capstone-Project


## Name: YumShare


## Overview

My web app will allow users to build their own online recipe "book". They will be able to look up specific food categories or recipes and all recipe books are public so everyone will have access to any recipes posted online. The purpose of this application is to allow users to interact with one another by sharing their recipes. Eventually users will be able to leave comments and create a list of their favorites as well as uploading photos.


## Functionality

* Users will need to create an account in order to begin using the application
* In order to create an account the minimum requirements are:
    * Username
    * Password
    * E-mail
    * Optional: 
        * Profile picture (if one isn't added a default picture will be automatically added)
        * Personal information (DOB, City/State, Biography)


At a minimum the application should be able to:
* Validate the username to make sure it isn't already taken
* Check to make sure the password meets the requirements
* The web page should constantly display:
    * Username
    * Profile image
    * Navigational bar
    * The current page
    * A search bar to lookup specific types of foods or recipes using keywords
    

## Data Model
